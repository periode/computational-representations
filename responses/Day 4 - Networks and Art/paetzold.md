# Networks and Art

## Quote

### "Netart does not have a tight visual language. It behaves rather like a chameleon."

One point art in genral is known for is, that it's hard to make bounderies for art. It's hard to discribe what art is and how it looks like. Netart doesn't just contains the word "art", the quote kind of agrees to the aspect that it could be very, too.  

## About the texts

The texts are about networks and how they influence communication and online creativity. For instance, art pieces, that only work on the net, could have structural components, so that different people all over the world can modify that single piece. This combines all the topic from the introduction. The art piece starts to build a very user friendly community. The user doesn't even have to create an account, so he or she doesn't have to login too, what allows him or her a faster workflow. But this anonymity also creates a space for misuse.

Stephen Merche describes in his text "The Crisis of Intimacy in the Age of Digital Connectivity" that his son had the chance to ask a digital holographic bot more intimite questions then he would have ask a  real human. He lost the distance he would have to an adult or an old man. That's good, because people and especially children should be allowed to ask questions. But perhaps, this comes along with a little loose of respect. Maybe the loose of distance people will be known from robots will be apllied to other poeple what changes the social interactions under humans. This influence to the social behavior could be as detrimental as much it could be revolutionary. 
... or as Merche mentioned the "digital connectivity has [already] transformed every
human interaction."
