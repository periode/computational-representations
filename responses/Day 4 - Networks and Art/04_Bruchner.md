## **My favorite Quote:**

### "*Since my boyhood, the rise of digital connectivity has transformed every human interaction, from buying a sandwich to anal sex.*" 

## **Genral Informations about the Text**

### In the text, the author talks about the change of human intimacy, their handling, their perception and how "*the intimacy has been transferred to another format.*". He explains this change through the advent of social media & smartphones and titled as Crisis of Intimacy. In his view, we use the internet to express and satisfy our personal needs but paradoxically we don't trust what other people share and develop an absence of empathy. He also explains, why and how this "*Crisis of Intimacy*" affected the Artists: "*Because we feel we know who they are now, artists, not their works, are the connection we crave.*" He ends up with the Conclusion, that this format of intimacy is rooted in the digital connectivity itself and that a modification of the technology will not be able to change that.

### According to him, our intimacy would be defined of the things we don't share on the Internet.

### I agree with a lot of Points and Examples in his text like we found a lot of Nazism in social media or. they are an integral part of social media, and maybe without them, social media would not be such a big thing. BUT then e brings some so radical Statement, that sometimes I get really angry as I read his text. For example, as he talks about the Connection between the Digital Connectivity and the change of our sex life:

### "*Tinder is not romance*"

### "*Masturbation used to be a work of memory and imagination, a dreamlike reconstitution of the erotic considerations of the every day.*"

### "*We have recharged sex with so much meaning that people are having less of it.*"

### In my View, you can't say, that Tinder is not romance, cause it depends first of all on your definition what romance is and how you use this application. For example, a lot of people criticize, that Tinder just focused on the external, but if you think about a Dating Situation in a Club or Bar. For me, it seems obvious, that you wouldn't ask somebody for a date or. something like that, if this Person isn't in some way attractive for you. And that's, for me, the same Situation for Tinder.

### I think he wants to provoke with all these Sexexamples. Cause that is, maybe for some people, the most intimate of human beings.

### In the End, I also agree with his Point, that moreover, we lost our sense and value of Intimacy. But I also see some god Examples for sharing moments of "pure Intimacy", where people are empathic, help each other and inspire each other. So I would argue that this change is a Crisis.

## **My favorite Quote**

### "*The Internet as a mirror of a neo-liberal capitalism is an extremely interesting experimental layout, full of inspiration for artists, hackers and other field reseachers.*"

## **Genral Informations about the Text**
### In the text, the Author talks about online networks and how they influence online creativity. In his Introduction, he explains the differences between art on the net and net art. Art on the net is nothing more than a big telephone book, they only use the Internet for distribution the Art pieces. Netart functions only on the net and picks out the net as a theme. He distinguishes between two forms of Netart: 1. Context Systems & 2. Researchers, Troublemakers, Individual Perpetrators (individual Net artist)
### Context systems intend the development of communities and individual net artists do not take the visitors or the limits of the medium web into account. 
### Referring to my favorite Quote, I agree with him, that it is necessary to get a critical look at the content offered to you.
