# Joachim Blank: Net Art

Blank describes what he considers "Net Art". He contrasts it to the representation of traditional art on the internet and defines it as art that is dependent upon the medium of the internet. "Net Art" in this sense is art that is created through collaboration beyond its original author or group. Inside net art, he differentiates between building "Context Systems" that enable that collaboration and do not distinguish between creator and user; and individuals that experiment on their own with conventions in the medium, its navigation and usage.

I'm not sure if I have ever experienced a form of actual 'net art' myself. The closest thing to a context system could be Newgrounds, pushing the collaboration aspect.

# Stephen Marche: The Crisis of Intimacy...

> Nothing any digital technology company could do, other than to stop making digital technology, would assuage the inescapable brokenness of our condition

Marche states that (internet) technology has the inherent property to dissolve our perception of intimacy. He sees a coincidence with increased loneliness and narcissism as well as difficulties of defining boundaries of intimacy. He concludes that these issues cannot be avoided inside the medium and therefore intimacy needs to be removed from the network altogether.

I was confused on his Wittgenstein reference. At first, Marche initially claims the internet has verified what Wittgenstein thought unverifiable and later says it still upholds. However, his examples for the former, the blue/white dress photo and the Laurel/Yanni sound don't work well, as they reference one's external articulation of what someone perceives and not the actual perception itself.
