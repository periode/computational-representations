# Netart
*"A group or an individual designs a system that can
be expanded by other people. Along with that is the idea
that the collaboration of a number of people will become the
condition for the development of an overall system."*

The author begins with the distinction between art on the net and netart. Art on net tries to promote its art, while netart relies on the the net as a medium. There are essentially two manifestations of netart: Context Systems and individual netartists.  
Context systems intend the development of communities, wherein "every active user can become a perceptible component" and "developing perceptible claims for artistic-cultural activities on the net" as a "collective group project".  
According to the Author individual netartists (or groups) do not take the visitors or the limits of the medium web into account. They do not have limiting boundaries to what they create. This would result fast pacing development of trends in design (on the web). Also it possible to completely disregard standards on the web or to lie.

Therefore the author questions the "the credibility of the exchange of information in a media-dominated society". He also points out, that the "Internet as a mirror of a neo-liberal capitalism is an extremely interesting experimental layout, full of inspiration for artists, hackers and other field reseachers.".

I agree with the author, that the internet frees one from boundaries and on the other hand being used to spread misinformation. Therefore a user should always be advised to question the content he is consuming.

# The Crisis of Intimacy in the Age of Digital Connectivity
*In an all-sharing world, what we donâ€™t share will define us.*

The author talks about how the digital age change the way we perceive intimacy. The overflow of information made us seemingly more blunt towards the sensation of intimacy. He also states: "Or, rather, there is no more and no less intimacy now than there was during the analog era; the intimacy has been transferred to another format." According to him, we use the internet to express and satisfy our personal needs, but on the other hand do not trust what other people share and develop an absence of empathy. 
Furthermore her talks about artists on the internet and that "Because we feel we know who they are now, artists, not their works, are the connection we crave.". He concludes, that this format of intimacy is rooted in the digital connectivity itself and that a modification of the technology will not be able to change that. Furthermore, that the essence of the human is not information and intimacy is not what can be shared over networks.

I agree that digital connectivity has led to a lot of narcissistic behaviour on the internet and also has turned into a place, where intimacy can only be found rarely. For me the online profiles of people seemingly do not really represent the essence of their character. 
But I also see situations, where people are empathic and help each other out on the internet. I think that I disagree that we cannot change the way we handle intimacy over shared networks, it is a fast evolving technology, which is not that old and I believe that our point of view on the web can change / evolve.
