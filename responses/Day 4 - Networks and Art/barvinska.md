# Day 4


## Quote:

### from Joachim Blank:
Netart functions only on the net and picks out the net or the "netmyth" as a theme. It often deals with structural concepts: A group or an individual designs a system that can be expanded by other people. Along with that is the idea that the collaboration of a number of people will become the condition for the development of an overall system.

### from Stephen Marche: 
In an era slick with information, clever beyond belief, intelligent beyond the fantasies of our ancestors, our understanding of what constitutes a person is as primitive as it has ever been.

While reading the text I couldn't stop comparing net art to some performative action. Sure, unlike any fleeting performance net art could happen over and over again, and it also has a certain fixed location on some server (at least temporary). Yet there is something in this type of art that makes it truly performative for me. 
For instance, net art has a peculiar temporality: the temptation to be distracted away by clicking on some other link or by opening a new page is so strong that it’s extremely difficult to resist. After visiting a page only once the chances to never return can be really high. Similarly to performance, the art peace exists here and now, and after being performed, it gets lost in the space. 

I also think that performing is much more engaging than seeing others perform (at least, it is for me with an audiovisual performance). The same could be said about the art on the net: it is rather a participatory pleasure, an emerging value from the collaborative efforts. 

### Stephen Marche

I remember myself when the internet rocketed into my personal space, opened a whole new world of unlimited knowledge (books!!), and challenged everything I valued at that time, including relationship, self-image, and intimacy. I mostly experienced everything Marche describes and thought this to be a revolutionary tool destined to transform the future of human interaction. But what happened instead is I quickly got bored. For the internet, it didn’t offer anything exciting and radically new for me, but just built the wall between me and the world out there.

The internet, one of the most stimulating and yet to be explored human toys, is only one of many examples of the pattern we follow when we react to a new 'revolutionary' tool. First comes excitement, then comes addiction, then comes disappointment (because the promise of happiness is never fulfilled) and, finally, follows indifference.
Likewise, being exposed to all the revelations, intimacies and flesh of the internet, sooner or later we come to the point when even the suddenly exposed perverseness of your boss / teacher/ neighbour becomes unbearably boring, all bodies look the same, and all people talk the same pathetic nonsense inflated by the same dubious and allegedly deep meaning.

Today, I enjoy much more sending physical letters to people who matter a great deal to me than emailing them quick lines. I also find much more intriguing and playful to interact with people in real life: to smell them, accidentally touch them, exchange looks, hear the failures of their voices, notice small pieces of food stuck between their teeth. It’s all much more imaginative and stimulating for me.
I want to believe that this can be a story about every one of us. Because in the end, we are all longing for love and understanding, and the internet just cold-bloodedly pins it down.
