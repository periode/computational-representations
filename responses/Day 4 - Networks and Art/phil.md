# Netart

>The Internet as a mirror of a neo-liberal capitalism is an extremely interesting experimental layout, full of inspiration for artists, hackers and other field reseachers.

Blank differentiates between "netart" and "art on the net". While the latter contains only a documentation of art which is created outside of the net, "real" netart only works inside of it and uses its structures as an essential part of the work. After defining those terms he describes two different manifestations of netart: Context systems going "back to the idea of developing perceptible claims for artistic-cultural activities" are creating communities of netartists, individual netartists or groups ("Researchers, Troublemaker, Individual Perpetrators") on the other hand are operating on their own "without having to take into account the visitors on the Web sites or the limits of the medium". Unfortunately most of Blanks examples are not available anymore, but I had an interesting time reloading jodi.org again and again.

# The Crisis of Intimacy in the Age of Digital Connectivity

>The ethereal nature of digital connection — its ephemerality, its facelessness — stands in counterpoint to the fleshiness and materiality of the analog.

In this text Marche describes the "crisis of intimacy" we live through right now. He disagress to the idea that we traded intimacy for technology, but rather sees a step-up in intimacy through the digital, which is so extreme that we have been "overwhelmed by revelations of an intimate nature". The reason lies in the form of the ubiquitos digital, which could be seen as everything else than intimate, but exactly this leads us to creating more and more intimate and private content through it: "The content of the internet is always in rebellion against its form." The ability to recognize another's private experience, our empathy, on the other hand disappears more and more.
Interestingly Marche also writes about the impact of this phenomenon on art. Before the age of digital connectivity we saw the artworks without thinking about the private life of the artist. But nowadays we concentrate only on the artists as a "social avatar, a figure of shared sensations and values" that blocks our view.
I liked reading the text, although I have the feeling that some of Marches points are a bit too one-sided and pessimistic. Is it really not possible to get "connected" through the internet on an empathetic level? In contrast to the author I rather believe in a widespread misapplication of technology than in an "inescapable brokenness of our condition".
