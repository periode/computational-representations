### The text "A New Imagination" from Vilém Flusser deals with the Change & the different consequences of the imagination on human development. Flusser describes the development & analysis of human imagination with examples from cave painting to VR. For him these self-expressionism "its a theme of philosophical and theological speculation[..][,] an “intentional” gesture". This gesture commences, according to Flusser, with a movement of abstraction. Without Imagination, we cannot comprehend and deal with the world.

### If I understand him in the correct way, we are again currently in the middle of a change in our imagination. He defined this new kind of imagination is "pure aesthetic". And it begins with the uprise of computers and their ability to project and edit images.

### "*, images can now be completely and thoroughly analyzed.*"

### For him, it is a new kind of imagination, because people are no longer bound in their imagination to the limitation of "real life". This abstract form of imagination is for pure aesthetics.

### "*even Plato could not object to these images, because they are “pure ideas.*"

### For me, the most interesting passage was, as I realized that he sees images not only as "images" like painting etc. For him "Images" are any kind of Imagination of a situation. And therefore Images can be calculated of situations (plane example) because the calculation is a description of a situation, and that is a picture or Image. I agree to the fact, that computers enable us, expressing circumstances, that would probably not be possible without them. We are trying to break out of the limitation of our real life through digital computer art in order to expand our selves.

### "*The range of works entered for the transmediale.01 software art award shows that coding is a highly personal activity. Code can be diaries, poetic, obscure, ironic or disruptive, defunct or impossible, it can simulate and disguise, it has rhetoric and style, it can be an attitude.*"

### The text "Software Art" by Florian Cramer & Ulrike Gabriel attempts to give an overview of software art and the importance of software to our view of art. The two authors are concerned with the development of software art, its definition and its impact on human self-realization. Above all, they criticize the fact that computer art is not regarded as an independent art form but stands under the term "new media". In her view, it implies that computer art, the art of zeros and ones, is derived from video art.One of the consequences is that perception is not focused on program structure but only on visual output.

### "*a term which covers analog and digital media alike and is historically rooted in video art. But isn't it a false assumption that digital art - i.e. art that consists of zeros and ones - was derived from video art, only because computer data is conventionally visualized on screens?*"

### I'm still not sure how much I agree with the two authors on this point. I also think that you pay too little attention to the program structure, the blackbox, behind great digital artworks. But I'm not sure if this is not just a general "problem" of humanity. Not to concentrate on the inner, but only on the outside.
