# A New Imagination
*First, man took a step back from his life-world, to imagine it. Then, man stepped back from the imagination, to describe it. Then, man took a step back from the linear, written critique, to analyze it. And final- ly, owing to a new imagination, man projected synthetic images out of analysis.* (p.7)

I am not completely sure if I completely understood the text...  
Vil√©m Fluss writes about how the imagination of human beings changed over their past (see quote). The way I understood it is, that according to the author, we are currently in the middle of a change in our imagination and it began with the uprise of computers and their ability to project and edit images. This shifts our imagination from being attached to representing the life-world, to a more abstract representation of calculations, which then leads to a "true expression" of "pure aesthetics".

If I understood correctly, he means, that we are moving to a society which focuses more on expressing things/thoughts through art, rather than representing the real world. I mostly agree to the fact, that computers enable us, expressing circumstances, that would probably not be possible without them. Which do not mainly focus on mainly representing the "life-world". 


# Software Art
*Software art means a shift of the artist's view from displays to the creation of systems and processes themselves;*

I think, the text is about how software art is defined and how it can be perceived. Software art (its output) can be easily seen, but what cannot be seen, is the process, the system, the programming. It is like "conceptual art", where the artist defines the concept and the machine executes ("interprets") it. The authors state: "[...] we would like to define software art as art of which the material is software.". 

I fully agree with the authors, that software art is not solely the output of a machine, but also "[...] is highly concerned with artistic subjectivity and its reflection and extension into generative systems.".
