# A New Imagination

## Quote 

### "First, man took a step back from his life-world, to imagine it. Then, man stepped back from the imagination, to describe it. Then, man took a step back from the linear, written critique, to analyze it. And finally, owing to a new imagination, man projected synthetic images out of analysis." p. 7

- Was a good summary. 

## About the texts

The text draws a line between physical imagaes and mental images towards the presentation on computers. It says the human imagination gets nourrished by the natural, physical environment and that this process is required for every human (creative) output. The author also points out a the value of critique and shows an algorithm to create appropriate critiques. 

In the beginnig of the text I expected a way too abstract article, because I could live with "imagination or visualization: it is often taken as a given, as a fact." p. 1 Also as the second chapter "Critique of Image Criticism" startet with critique on the "usual way" (how I understood it first) what deterred me, too. But beside all the high-level-philosophy-words the author managed to show, what his intention was.  

"Then, one can modify these preserved images; one can become engaged in a sort of dialogue between oneâ€™s own imagination and the imagination fed into the computer." p. 6 The argument, that the computer is like a tool to display the own imagination seems valid to me.
