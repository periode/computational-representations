# Day 3


## Quote:

### from Vilém Flusser:
But what concerns us right now in an existential sense is the burdensome, but necessary, leap out of the linear into the zero-dimensional (into the realm of “quanta”) and into synthesizing (into computation). We have been challenged to leap into the new imagination (p. 116).

### from Florian Cramer and Ulrike Gabriel: 
A) Software art means a shift of the artist's view from displays to the creation of systems and processes themselves...

B) But unlike the Cagean artists of the 1960s, the software artists we reviewed seem to conceive of generative systems not as negation of intentionality, but as balancing of randomness and control. Program code thus becomes a material with which artist work self-consciously. Far from being simply art for machines, software art is highly concerned with artistic subjectivity and its reflection and extension into generative systems.


## General response:
### Vilém Flusser

I picked the quote above because this is the statement I can instantly agree with. As for the rest of the text, after going through it several times, I have many entangled, not well-formed thoughts and one big hunch telling me that deep down in my thoughts I may, at least to some extent, agree with Flusser. However, I would like to point down a few things in the text that puzzled me the most. 

First, I didn’t fully grasp whether Flusser talks about ‘old images’ as only images that aim at mimesis or at any other figurative representation in general or he labels all non-digital images as ‘old’. It makes sense to do the former but I would argue against the latter. 
Second, as I interpret Flusser, “the human being adjusts to his life-world” with the help of ‘intentional’ imagination that uses images to mediate the world around. If so, then the new imagination would either completely disconnect us from the world around or it would produce just another mediation of reality. In this case, what kind of reality this is or could potentially be? Also, I wasn’t secure about Flusser’s definition of imagination, it looks like he uses this word quite loosely. 
Finally, I was wondering whether a new imagination is a more superior type of imagination for Flusser, or it simplifies the world around (as, for example, going from the reality in four dimensions to the zero dimension of the binary code). 
Overall, what Flusser proposes is a quite radical view on the ontology of image creation. Although his theory is graceful and thought-provoking, to come to some kind of conclusion (agree/disagree) I would need to read the whole text and maybe to have more time to think through it. 

### Florian Cramer and Ulrike Gabriel

It stroke me that until this moment, I’ve been considering software art to be merely a very small subset in a vibrant media art scene. Yet, as Cramer and Gabriel point down, software art may have its own ontology that seems to (at least to some extent) deviate from media art with its broad focus on digital media. 

I totally agree with the author’s intuition that the generation of processes and creation of systems are in the focus of software art. For me, this feature opens a broad range of possibilities not only to be creative with the medium but also to be critical. More specifically, through making art by writing software we can glance inside the abstract structures, make them physical, tangible, and embodied. In a way, this process can be seen as Derrida’s deconstruction but instead of natural language, we could use code; and instead of writing about it, we could write it. 
However, this is not to say that we must be critical at all accounts.
