# Cramer, Gabriel: Software Art

> Thirty years later, after personal computing became ubiquituous, cultural stereotypes of what software is have solidified. Although _the expectation that software is, unlike other writing, not an aesthetic, but a "functional tool'' itself is an aesthetic expectation_ [...].

(emphasis by me)

The article reflects on classifying software as an art form in the context of jury work for the transmediale festival 2001, the first occurence of an award for "software art". It observes that the art world has traditionally viewed software as a tool for producing other media and digital data as a medium to encode other media such as video, audio, image and text. It proposes that for "software art", computing systems should be viewed as a language of itself. They refer to similar previous views in Conceptual Art and Donald Knuth's "The Art of Programming".

What left me impressed was that, unlike most texts reflecting on "art", it outlines a clear context and purpose for its discussion instead of building on the assumption that the reader has some background in the subject it covers. It briefly talks about viewing software as pure utility to achieve other means and I agree with the text that this is a very limited view - I think software and data is unspecific enough to leave room for personal expression, even when coding tools.

The text is about procedurally generated images and their distinction from "traditional" images. They are the result of calculations and therefore represent abstract concepts, while traditional images are meant as a representation of reality. Therefore, because traditional image criticism assumes the latter intent, "human" analysis is unable to interpret this new kind of images.

I had serious difficulty deciphering the text's vocabulary and structure, so I find myself unable to form any solid opinion on it. Would have to spend more time reading it to get a good idea.
