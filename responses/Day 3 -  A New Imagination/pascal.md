A new imagination

“all the artificial techniques that were once considered necessities, such as differential
calculus, have become superfluous: it is now possible to count with fingers, even if this means using superhuman, speedy, automatic calculating
machines.“

The text deals with the changes that come from dealing with digitally created images. Images, in the context of the text, mean the abstraction of natural facts or phenomenon.
I'm not quite sure, I understand the text completely but I believe the author is trying to explain how relying on computed images gives a more accurate and less debatable perspective on these images.
I certainly agree on a higher accuracy but still thing that these images should be looked at very critically. I think it is important to differentiate between images that might be computed correctly and those that can actually represent nature accurately.


Software Art

“Software art means a shift of the artist's view from displays to the creation of systems and processes themselves”
The text aks about the definition of software art. According to the author, software art can consist of art through formal instructions or art that can show the underlying systematic structure of systems in a way that they are actually functioning instead of how they are meant to be viewed.
