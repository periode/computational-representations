#A New Imagination

>First, man took a step back from his life-world, to imagine it. Then, man stepped back from the imagination, to describe it. Then, man took a step back from the linear, written critique, to analyze it. And finally, owing to a new imagination, man projected synthetic images out of analysis.

Flusser writes about imagination as different types of gestures of image production. He begins describing it as a "strange nonplace" we enter when we draw images for ourselves (called "subjectivity" or "existence"). Those images act as a mediation between the objective and subjective world and have a "tendency to block the path to the objects they mediate".
Flusser points at how important imagination is for us to orient ourselves in the world. He objects the prohibition of image creation but wants us to critique the images to enlighten the subjective imagination.
I had some problems understanding the following part. He is somehow explaining the impact of computer technology on our understanding of and discussion about imagination? Afterwards he is writing about the process of synthesizing images with a computer for eventually comparing that to the cave paintings he mentioned in the beginning. In the end I couldn't fully grasp Flussers differentiation of the imagination types and therefore look forward to our discussion.


#Software Art

>Tracing concept art to artistic formalisms like twelve-tone music, Flynt argues that the structure or concept of those artworks is, taken for itself, aesthetically more interesting than the product of their physical execution. In analogy, we would like to define software art as art of which the material is software.

Fortunately the message of this text was much more easy to understand. Cramer and Gabriel write about what the term "software art" means for them, versus how it is often identified as (new) media art. I agree that software art should not only be perceived and evaluated through the outcome of the execution of the code, but also as an artistic "creation of systems and processes" on its own.
