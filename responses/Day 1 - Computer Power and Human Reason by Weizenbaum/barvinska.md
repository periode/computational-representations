# Computer Power and Human Reason


## Quote:

The spiritual cosmologies engendered by modern science, one the other hand, are infected with the germ of logical necessity. They, except in the hands of the wisest scientists and philosophers, no longer content themselves with explanations of appearances, but claim to say how things actually are and must necessarily be. In short, they convert truth to provability (p.12).


## General response:
The author addresses a range of challenging questions related not only to the place of computational systems in our lives but also to the question of who we are as thinking and cognising species in general. 

I also like a conversational manner of the author, his motivation to engage the reader, rather than to demonstrate how verse he is. 
Stylistically, this is one of my favourite ways of constructing an argument. 

I mostly agree with everything Weizenbaum says in the text, especially about attributing intentionality to computers and about the puzzle of knowledge. The latter made me think whether we need an understanding in computers and, of course, in the classical sense, ponder about what understanding is (the Chinese room thought experiment). By any means, this is an introduction, and there is much more to follow and to argue about. 

My favourite part is related to the fallacy of empirical science, the only justified belief that we, as allegedly chosen by evolution and therefore so special species, have created. We seem to cultivate rational thinking from the day we learn to speak and teach kids how to be an effective, intellectual, right-handed citizen. In doing so, we construct the artificial boundaries between us and the world and between us as we see ourselves and us as we are. 

Having said that, I'm doubting that the radical mechanisation of humans will ever take place. For it, there will always be a utopian movement of artists or other likeminded decedents.
