### "[...] science is creative, [...]" p. 2

(Full scentence: "That science is creative, that the creative act in science is equivalent to the creative act in art, that creation springs only from autonomous individuals, is such as imple and, one might think, obvious idea.")

It's true and for everybody to whom this is not omnipresent, it's probably a good reminder that the result of a creative process doesn't always have to be what commonly is known as art (like paintings and so on.) And also that science is not that dry and stringent medium that it seems to be from time to time. 

## About the text

The Text is about the understanding of the context of natrual language, a thereof resulting computer administered psychotherapy, human interaction with the (for that time) new kind of system and how this interaction became a new research topic. 

Weizenbaum developed a system via one could converse during the post-war period. As soon as he recognized how people use his software, he decided to store the conversations for analysis and evaluation. His justification was that "[...] one person migth help another learn to cope with his emotional problems [...]"(p. 5). Collecting data and to analyse them is fundamental to develop systems. Especially if the results are usefull for even more specialist areas, there should be a way found to do so. But today Weizenbaums approach would be against the law, because of all the current policies regading to data protection. It should be said, that today people have to be informed that the data will be collected and for what the data will be used. A declaration of consent from the people who take part is advisable. 

The text reaches a point where a short discussion about a still well known topic is started. "Now there are signs that a full-scale debate about the computer is developing. The contestants on one side are those who, briefly stated, believe computers can, should, and will do everything, and on the other side those who, like myself, believe there are limits to what computers ought to be put to do." (p. 12) We know this for instance from mondern science fiction movies about AIs. Computers become superpowers in these movies and in the fantasies of some people they will have even more skills then humans couldn't even imagine. Weizenbaum says "I would argue that, however intelligent machines may be made to be, there are some acts of thought that ought to be attempted only by humans." (p. 13) And I totally agree. At the end are all these computers - software and hardware - still automates. They have difined states. They are made by humans, that know how the components work. Currently I can't imagine computers with an own mind that work suddenly autonomously.

_Edit 22.01.2019: I wrote this without any knowleadge of machine learning. From the part with "difined states" the text is obviously not correct._ 

At the end of the text Weizenbaum remarked a strong thesis by saying "People viewed the arts, especially literature, as sources of intellectual nourishment and understanding, but today the arts are perceived largely as entertainments." (p. 16) strengthened by the scentence: "We can count, but we are rapidly forgetting how to say what is worth counting and why."(p. 16) At the first moment I totally disagreed, but even if he's right, I ask myself why entertainment often gets such a bad touch. I think visual art as medium for political statements is great, but why is something that makes you laugh and happy less worth then something that make you think. One hand promotes the "progress of the humankind" and the other hand _just_ the individual satisfaction?


##### Short story out of Franzis life:
The first time I heard of Josef Weizenbaum was in school and I remember how fascinated I was from Eliza. This was of course one of my wow-computer-science, what were the reasons of why I chose an advanced computer science course during my a-levels and finally decided to study media and computing. During my studies I saw Eliza for the first time in "real life" in the Computerspiele Museum in Berlin. It was still a moment I was looking forward to (you know - because of the wow-moment in school). I don't know exactly what Weizenbaums program made it so special to me, but I think also to use a system as psychotherapist during the post-war period made important points.
