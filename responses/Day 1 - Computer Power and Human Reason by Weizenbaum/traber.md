# Computer Power and Human Reason

*Thus have we very nearly come to the point where almost every genuine human dilemma is seen as a mere para­ dox, as a merely apparent contradiction that could be untangled by judicious applications of cold logic derived from a higher standpoint.*

I think Weizenbaums main idea proposed in the introduction is about the manifestation of logic in our society as a fundamental tool to explain or resolve anything. Therefore, I chose the quote above.
He underlines this argument with the fact, that some practicing psychiatrists believed his DOCTOR software could be enhanced in order to automate treatment of patients and therefore reducing their treatment to a sequence of logic (p. 5, 6). He states: *"I had thought it essential, as a prerequisite to the very possibility that one person might help another learn to cope with his emotional problems, that the helper himself participate in the other's experi­ ence of those problems and, in large part by way of his own empathic recognition of them, himself come to understand them."* (p. 5, 6). I completely agree with him, that a psychiatrists treatment should also include comprehension and empathy. But as Colby states, the psychiatrist would not be replaced, rather enhanced by the software, being able to attend more patients at once. I think it highly depends how the tool is perceived. Is it just an extension of the psychiatrist (for easy tasks) or is it replacing a real treatment. One example of a book in AR class was, that a modern AI, rendering a cute seal on a tablet and interacting with the observer (named Paro), is being used for seniors, suffering from dementia, in order to amuse and entertain them. On one hand you could argue, that it is kind of sad, that we have to use such software, but on the other hand, if it fullfills the purpose, why not use it. 

But I think I am drifting apart, as the authors argument is more about having to break down every problem to logic. And this is something I can relate with, because at the moment we see a trend where Machine Learning is beeing used in order to evaluate human beings, e.g. the likeliness of committing another crime (https://www.wired.com/2017/04/courts-using-ai-sentence-criminals-must-stop-now/) or if a person should be hired for a company. In my opinion this is a very unethical way of judging people, as of now we do not know how these algorithms come to their solution (as we currently have no insight) and also their judgment is based on statistics, which cannot predict the truth of an individuals future. People get punished for things, they may do in the future (as the statistics suggests), but it is not nearly certain, that this may happen.

I totally agree, that logic is not the only problem solver we can rely on and that emotions and ethical thinking should be a huge stepping stone in our society. I don't condemn tools like I mentioned above, but they should be used in a reasonable manner.

I am coming to the conclusion, that I am in fact a bit worried about where this trend of seeing things mainly logically. But I am also very hopeful, that we will find the right ways to maintain classic human characteristics. He may be right, that art and media are often just as entertainment perceived, but I also see people being educated through art. E.g. a lot of photographers feel a deep connection to nature and communicate about environmental pollution through art. I also see a rise in science communication through modern media, which addresses the authors problem of not beeing able to convince the public of their misconception of his work.
All in all I also see a lot of people not following a solely logical path and addressing issues, that cannot be resolved by logic.
