# Computer Power and Human Reason

>It is perhaps paradoxical that just, when in the deepest sense man has ceased to believe in - let alone to trust - his own autonomy, he has begun to rely on autonomous machines, that is, on machines that operate for long periods of time entirely on the basis of their own internal realities. If his reliance on such machines is to be based on something other than unmitigated despair or blind faith, he must explain to himself what these machines do and even how they do what they do. This requires him to build some conception of their internal "realities." (p. 9)

What I find most interesting in Weizenbaum introduction to "Computer Power and Human Reason" is how early he expresses concerns about how technology and especially machines with "artifical intelligence" are often perceived as universal solutions to everything. The example of his language analysis program ELIZA which was misunderstood as an alternative to human psychotherapists demonstrates the high hopes in new technologies and the impact such innovations can have - which also arises questions about the responsibility of scientists.

Weizenberg saw clear limits in what computers can do and 42 years later I still agree to that. Of course I can imagine a practical use for AI in psychotherapy, but when it comes to fully understanding human problems, I guess we haven't and maybe will never reach the point where a computer can outdo any human with real rather than simulated empathy.

Some of Weizenbaums concerns have been somehow confirmed with the arise of machine learning. Nowadays we build machines which decide about a variety of aspects of our life. Some with less serious impact, e.g. music recommendations, and some with more, e.g. sentencing decisions in courts. While 1976 Weizenbaum said that "most men don't understand computers to even the slightest degree" (p. 9) and therefore shouldn't rely on it, with the so called "black box" algorithms today nobody can exactly tell what is going on and what the machine's decision is based on - even those who developed them.
