"Then, too, I'm constantly confronted by students, some of whom have already rejected all ways but the scientific to come to know the world, and who seek only a deeper, more dogmatic indoctrination in that faith (although that word is no longer in their vocabulary)."

"Then, too, I'm constantly confronted by students, some of whom have already rejected all ways but the scientific to come to know the world, and who seek only a deeper, more dogmatic indoctrination in that faith (although that word is no longer in their vocabulary)."

The text touches on various subjects, starting with the anthropomorphism of machines, the attempts to explain the concepts of human thought with computational systems and the uprise of a narrow, unreasonably certain and logic-driven world view.
It is mostly critical about these developments and paints a rather bleak vision of the present (1976) and future, in which complex natural and political problems are reduced to simple logical constructs that can be avoided with a single specific solution.

I believe that it is not only admirable but essential to question the very foundation of all systems that we craft our beliefs and ideologies around. Science is no exception to that. The realization that science is not some kind of undeniable truth but merely an overly simplified model of our reality is crucial. Not to do so, as the author puts it, would be highly irrational.

Furthermore, the author’s observations on the narrowly logical approaches of certain scholars and self proclaimed problem-solvers to rather complex subject matters are quite interesting and his comparisons to blind fate rather fitting. However, I disagree with him on the actual weight of this problem. I do not see science as a emerging de facto religion that is rapidly spreading among society causing a depreciation and simplification of our world. On the contrary, I see a rise of pseudo-science and populism among modern societies. I believe the problem might be more evident in academic cycles and the economic sector. 

And while I can certainly understand the author’s worries, the attempt to use the scientific method to, for example, solve political or social problems, is not a bad thing. In fact, it is best option, if the approach is purely scientific and data-driven and not corrupted by personal interests, prejudice, paranoia and general public opinion.

On top of that, with the progress of artificial intelligence and the increasingly interconnected world, I see a shift towards that kind of computed decision-making as an inevitability. The complexity of global geopolitical relations already exceeds all human understanding. While an AI will not find the perfect solution to every problem, it will, by definition, attempt to find the optimal solution.
