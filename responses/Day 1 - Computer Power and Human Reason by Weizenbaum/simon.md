I agree with Weizenbaum in the way I understood his text, that it is good to maintain a adequate amout of sceptisism towards the seeming wonders and ultimate truths of technology. This is I think also worth keeping in mind, while observing the ongoing discussion about the possibilities claimed, if not to say the prophecies made concering the current advancements of AI.  

On the other hand I would still consider technology as a tool in the hands of men, so it depends on the person who uses it. 

And another (not fully elaborated) thought:  
I am not sure what to infer from Weizenbaums considerations not to believe in the pure rationality of science. If this means to rely more on our intuitions - yes. If this means to accept a certain basic spirituality, that seems to be inherent in human beings nature - i agree. But I somehow can't help to sense a flavor of longing for "good old truths" as claimed by conservative, monotheistic religions. ("The Judaic tradition, for example, rests on the idea of a contractual relationship between God and man" p. 12)
