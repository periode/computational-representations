**Why this Quote?:**
blablablab

## **Genral Informations about the Text**

### Generally the Text of "*Computer Power Human Reason*" is about the discussion of the impact of the computer on man and his society and in this context the Author Weizenbaum marks a much larger Impact on man's role in the face of technologies and techniques he may not be able to understand and control. He also talks about the understanding of the context of natrual language and how a Human-Machien Interaction, his own Computerprogramm ELIZA, became a new research topic.
### In the firste section of the text Weizenbaum explains by means of a historical example that science is creative. And that this creative process is equivalent to that of art. This historical example also addressed him personally. As he says, it was not the fact that an important political personality championed his philosophy of science, but it reminded him that some people misinterpreted his former work ELIZA. 
### In the next section, he uses ELIZA to explain basic social problems. In this context he explain some "Schock-Moments", some Events in the Work with ELIZA, who encouraged him to think about then society and the impact of Technology and maschiens of them. With these examples he demonstrates the high hopes in new technologies, which also arises questions about the responsibility of scientists. 

### *Are  the scientist's responsibilities with respect to making his  work public?* (p. ...)                                                 *And  to  whom or what  is  the  scientist responsible?* (p....)

### **On of my favourite text part was, as Weizenbaum explain the diffrences between Humans as Thinker and Computer as Thinker**

### *"Now there are signs that a full-scale debate about the computer is developing. The contestants on one side are those who, briefly stated, believe computers can, should, and will do everything, and on the other side those who, like myself, believe there are limits to what computers ought to be put to do."* (p. 12)

### This passage has appealed to me because its a still well known topic. Science fiction films still play with the fear that AI will replace humanity. But Weizenbaum replies:    
### "*I would argue that, however intelligent machines may be made to be, there are some acts of thought that ought to be attempted only by humans.*" (p. 13)
### In this example Weizenbaum dont declare this diffrences as Emotiones but he said, that Computer and Maschines "*must ultimately deal with logicality itself*" (p. 13). And I totaly aggree with that. At the end are all these computers are made by humans, that know (hopefully) how the components work. Currently the Image of computers with an own mind is the result of the Science fiction films.
### What I find most interesting is how he expresses the quest of humanity for the key to every problem. In this Case how technology and especially machines are often perceived as universal solutions to everything. 
### "*I  had tried to say that no general solution to that problem was possible, i.e., that language is understood only in contextual frameworks,  that even these can be shared by people to only a  limited extent, and that consequently even people are not embodiments of any such general solution.*" (S. 6). I totaly aggree with that. This statement has made me think for a while.

### At the end of the text Weizenbaum comes with a strong and one of my favourite thesis:
### "*People viewed the arts, especially literature, as sources of intellectual nourishment and understanding, but today the arts are perceived largely as entertainments.*" (p. 16) "*We can count, but we are rapidly forgetting how to say what is worth counting and why.*"(p. 16) 
### I realy like this thesis, cause it made me question myself and my actions. For me Art (most of it) is an opportunity to make a strong political or social statement. Art is always a mirror of the society, and mabye we should think about, why Artist create Art that (just) makes you laugh and happy.
