“Conceptual Artists are mystics rather than rationalists. They leap to conclusions that logic cannot reach”

This text is comparing the artworks of Sol LeWitt to programming. Lewitt uses natural language to define a set of instructions that is then interpreted by a draftsperson and drawn onto a wall. This is similar to the way a programmer might provide a set of instructions through code to a machine which can then be interpreted and executed by the computer, however the computer is limited in his ability of interpretation and can only follow precise commands. A draftsperson on the other hand has the ability to fill in the gabs and add his on touch to the work, resulting in a more organic and diverse result.
I begin to wonder if this kind of technique can be applied to programming at some point in the future. When more progress in the research of AI is made, it might be possible for a good interpretation and execution of more complicated commands (I believe actual natural language processing will not happen anytime soon). This might result in a decrease of technical control the programmer will have over his creation but it might also result in new ways of approaching problems. In a way programmers could become artists or architects, focusing more on the actual conceptualization and realization of ideas instead of the tedious busy work and technicalities that they have to put up with at the moment. It might also lead to an increase of people with no or little technical know-how developing software and shifting focus on human-machine interactions and software solutions that might have been completely ignored by developers in the past.

“Programming in the 1950s does seem to have been fun and fairly gender balanced,
in part because it was so new and in part because it was not as lucrative
as hardware design or sales: the profession was gender neutral in
hiring if not pay because it was not yet a profession.”

The text touches on many subjects, from the very origins and definitions of software, the writing of machine code, the invention of high level languages and the development of modern user interfaces through guis among even more topics.
The part that struck me as the most interesting was the role women played in the early ages of programming.
