There are two topics I inferred from the text which I found quite interesting especially because I didn't know them before and hadn't thought about them in that way. The first is the developments of software and especially high level programming languages not as a logical consequence of dealing with the increasing complexity and performance of computers, but as a democratisation in a power struggle about (male) dominance through special knowledge, namely programers capability of that "black magic", being able to talk to the machine (computers) through highly mathematically machine code. The second issue to me pointed out in the text is the tragically crowding out of women and downplaying their contribution to the history of computer science, which seems to be interconnected to the first topic.
