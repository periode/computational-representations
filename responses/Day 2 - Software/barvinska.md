# Software


## Quote:

### from Hui Kyong Chun:
Thus abstraction both empowers the programmer and insists on his/her ignorance. Because abstraction exists “in the mind of the programmer,” abstraction gives programmers new creative abilities (p.38).

### from Casey Reas: 
A few obvious differences appear as a result of this re-coding. Computer screens have a much coarser resolution than a wall and as a result, the finished work lacks the warmth of a drawn surface in a physical space. In addition, machines can draw lines with absolute precision so all the imperfections in a physical drawing are removed, giving the rendering different characteristics than those intended by LeWitt. Do these differences distort the result? If this is a work of conceptual art, the concept should remain regardless of the medium.

Overall, the text is entertaining, and the argument is easy to follow. 
I enjoyed the analysis of software as women’s labour and especially, the point about creativity (see the quote above) that, in my opinion, could have been developed a bit deeper. 
At the same time, every analysis like this is a point of view, a manner of constructing a new discourse or contributing to an existing discourse. One can go into power relations and one can also create a positive account by looking at the possibilities or solutions (e.g., "this is quite a situation but what we can do about it"). I find it much easier to do the former (especially by referring to such pop-scholars as Baudrillard and by making ideology claims) and very challenging to do the latter. Honestly, Baudrillard was a major disappointment in the text but this is, of course, a very subjective, radical, and without a doubt biased opinion. Somehow everything that fells under the spell of Baudrillard's simulacra (and magically almost everything does) turns into a dystopian story of how pathetic we are and there is no way out.

My positive argument would be to examine what software offers us instead. Not in the sense that it opens broad possibilities to develop new technologies but in the sense of new unique affordances that we haven’t had before. For example, going back to creativity, designing software requires abstract thinking, like, for example, playing Tetris in your mind or constructing a building from Lego blocks in your imagination. Such abstract constructions (creative instead of mere simulations) could potentially create new neural pathways in our brain, and in the long run, could, in turn, create new mental (and even more bold, new brain) structures. This eventually boils down to the openness to all sort of changes, including changes in the way we think, process information, and function in general.

This text sparkled so many diverse thoughts in my head: from what is art and whether computational art is art per se to what is translation and how we could transfer the complicated philosophical discussion on structuralism onto the structures of software (the last point can be connected to the text "On Software"). 

I still didn’t form a firm opinion on how traditional art and computational art are intertwined and influence each other. However, I must say that for me as a person who internalised rather traditional modern art outlook, it took quite a while until I could finally start seeing the beauty in computational structures. One reason may be directly connected to the fact that I started to learn to programme myself and delved into the power of precise mental structures and into the complexity of translation from the stage of a fragile idea to the state of putting this idea into an algorithm. 

Another major insight I had while reading the text is that it may quite be that by trying to find a perfect order, a perfect structure, a perfect pattern in seemingly precise procedures, we highlight our own imperfection that, of course, is the most fascinating thing for artists. And framed in such a way, this quest could be, at least for me, a manifestation of art for art's sake. This was a very liberating insight for me.
