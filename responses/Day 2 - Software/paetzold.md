## Quote 

### "A benefit of working with software structures instead of programming languages is that itplaces the work outside the current technological framework, which is continually becoming obsolete." {Software} Structures by Casey Reas et. al. p. 7

I am not quite sure if I misunderstood the text, but I feel like the whole text was about a kind of selfmade software development pattern. In the quote it sounds like "software structures" (what I call a software development pattern) works without programming languages. Maybe what is ment is that the author prefers "software structures" instead of doesn't using a software development pattern? Or prefering "software structures" instead of other patterns? Because at the end there still has to follow a implementation in any programming language. 


## About the texts

I think that "{Software} Structures" by Casey Reas et. al. is a text about a software development pattern based on methods artits, espacilly painters, use. "On Software, or the Persistence of Visual Knowledge" by Wendy Hui Kyong Chun was even more about the whole development of software starting from software that processes physical data via operationg systems to specifc programming languages used to build the "end product software".


Interesting about the text (On Software, or the Persistence of Visual Knowledge) was that it gave me some background information about ENIAC, "ENIAC girls" or for example that software languages as we know them today weren't plannend. For a digital native it was also a good reminder that these calculater maschines weren't always that communication medium, that they are today. In principle everybody knows that, but as I said: It was a nice reminder and trigger to go through the developmenthostory of computers itself, too.

Wendy Hui Kyong Chun touches on some point the topic "open source" p. 6-7 or 31-32. Once I read an articel about a young programmer, who published a coding problem on the internet without asking her boss for permission. She ended up in a complicated situation and almost lost her job, because she shared confidential information/knowledge owned by the company for free on the internet. Her best justification reason during the discussion with her boss was obviously that it's better to share the code and get the task done instead of ending up with no result. But what was even more valuable for the whole open source discussion was that making mistakes is a huge part of programming. So sharing mistakes, asking for solutions and sharing solutions (/solution patterns) becomes an essential part of programming, too. 
Attention: Please ask nevertheless your boss first, before you share confidential information on the internet.
