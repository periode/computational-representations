### "*I want programming to be as immediate and fluid as drawing and I work with software in a way that minimizes the technical aspects.*"

### In his Essay, Casey Reas has tried to explore the potential influences of LeWitt's work on contemporary works of software. Therefore he has created three example software structures. Casey Reas focus on the possibility of separating a concept from the implementation. For him, it's important, leaving enough space for interpretation but also consists of a basic instruction to fulfill. For him, this Concept is like natural language.He illustrates how individual and creative the process of implementing a software structure is by means of different examples or different ways of programming.
### For me personally, it was hard to follow his text, cause the way he structured it was a little bit confusing and it was also a complete new topic for me. But nonetheless, his Essay brings a lot of tough in my Mind. Like: What is computational art? and how traditional art and computational art are influence each other.I love the idea of ​​programming as intuitive as possible.

# On Software, or the Persistence of Visual Knowledge by Wendy Hui Kyong Chun

## **My favourite Quote:**

### "*As our machines increasingly read and write without us, as our machines become more and more unreadable, so that seeing no longer guarantees knowing (if it ever did), we the so-called users are offered more to see, more to read. The computer—that most nonvisual and nontransparent device—has paradoxically fostered “visual culture” and “transparency.*"

## **Genral Informations about the Text**
### The Text from Wendy Hui Kyong Chun gives a huge overview of the history of computers and the emergence of programming and programming languages. From the problems of new media Studies to ENIAC & ENIAC Girls, the impact of Wars on different programming languages. Compared to the text of Casey Reas this text was pure entertainment and easy to follow. One of my favorite parts was her analysis of software as women’s labor and the Discussion about the ENIAC Girls. There was one Moment in her text, which opens my Eyes. She reminds that Computers (these calculator machines - she says) weren't always that communication medium, that they are today. And sure ist obviously but for me, a digital Native, a person who can't imagine a world without a modern computer, it was an interesting Moment of eye-opening.
### At one Part of the text, she talks about the generation Flash (according to Manovich). For me, this Part gives so many diverse thoughts in my head. Why Manovich calls them Artist and not a programmer, and at least I ask my self what are the differences between a Programmer and an Artist who create some Code?  
### Wendy Hui Kyong Chun thematizes on some point the topic "Transparency" or in her own Words"creating an invisible system of visibility." (p.28). In this passage she talks about the Background function, we could see and therefore not think about it. Like we moving files in different folders, but we do not know what exactly happens in the background. But for me, its also marks the problems in new media science, that people try to analyze new media, without basic background knowledge.
