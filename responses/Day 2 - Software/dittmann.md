# Reas: {Software} Structures

> The relation between LeWitt and his draftsperson is often compared to the relation between a composer and performer , but I think it's also valid to look at the comparison between a programmer and the entity of execution.

Reas writes about the transfer of structuralism to "software art". He refers to Sol LeWitt's "wall drawings" - drawing instructions for painting on a constrained space who are meant to be executed by individual artists. This itself is analogous to the relation between composer and musician. It's supposed to leave room for interpretation while maintaining an underlying "structure". He's practically implemented it by commissioning various software pieces from different artists in different implementations that follow the same general visual rules.

I've been a little annoyed by the text, as the term "structure" has its own meanings in the domain of software, while the text implicitly refers to something from the artistic domain.

I was also pretty surprised, following up on the quote above, that he didn't do a straightforward mapping of "programmer" to "programmer" and "entity of execution" to "machine"; he chose to regard himself as the "programmer", the commissioned artists as "entities of execution" and the computer as... the walls, I guess. That was at least surprising.

# Hui Kyong Chun: On Software

> According to Sadie Plant, programming is
essentially feminine—not simply because women, from Ada Lovelace
to Hopper, were the first programmers, but because of the historical
and theoretical ties between programming and what Freud called the
quintessentially feminine invention of weaving, between female
sexuality as mimicry and the mimicry grounding Turing’s vision of
computers as universal machines. (In addition, both software and
feminine sexuality reveal the power that something which cannot be
seen can have.)

I think it's about the ever-growing degree of abstraction that software allowed with regard to programming computers and how it makes programming more accessible. From removing the need to hard-wire machines, to removing the need to encode programs in the machine or even machine-specific languages, to even having no requirement anymore for knowing the underlying physical machine at all.

That's my guess anyway, since the closing paragraph suggests another intention. I found the article highly confusing and unstructured, referencing everything from Freud to Microsoft's Licenses. Therefore I couldn't connect this to any of my personal views on computing and media at first attempt.
