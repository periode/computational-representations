**Description**

From digital image processing to connected devices and artificial intelligence, we are more and more inclined to imagine our surroundings through the lens of the computer. However, the fundamental tension between continuous aspect of our lived, immediate, analog experience and the digital, discreet logic of software and hardware cannot be avoided, and can have increasing ramifications.

This seminar will be looking at the different ways that computers and computation have affected the way that we represent the world around us, and to what extent where social, political and economical forces involved in the process.

The seminar will be a combination of lectures, discussion and hands-on programming exercises.
